Wonderfull land of React
===============
Home of wonderfull projects made with ReactJs


##Just a counter
A very very minimal counter! It shows how long React has benn running, and thats about it! Haha, it was one of the very first project I did to learn the basics of React.

##Filtering Libraries
I wanted to have a place to find popular libraries so (using my new React skills) I made a filterable list using...you guessed it: React. Very 'miniama' again!

##A Good Looking nav bar ;)
Yet another 'minimal' project using react to iron out my misunderstanding and really grasp the concepts of components and binding and all that other fun stuff. Here I make a nav bar!

##A React-full Shoping cart
This is the most complex of the projects...so far! Here I made a shopping cart that uses filter by user input and by availability. Also added the ability to actually compute the total price of the order as you select the products
